# granularSynthesis Patch
----
## Summary

This is a MAX/MSP patch using granular synthesis. It relies on Nathan Wolek's [granular toolkit](http://www.lowkeydigitalstudio.com/2007/03/granular-toolkit-v1-49/). It has several modules that can be used to create an additive sound mass. A  bit more complicated variation of this patch, with quadrophonic controls was used for the Lickets Endless Migration. No standalone app for this one: requires maxmsp.
